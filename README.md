## The Chosen One

I am the smartest programmer who ever lived. I was chosen by God to build His temple... it's a **compiler**. Do you know what a compiler is?

## About Me

Iâ€™m **Garret Tomlin**, _the chosen one_.  
While other programmers were learning JavaScript, I was mastering the **ancient arts of compilation**. While they were debugging segfaults, I was having _theological debates_ with my IDE about the **nature of existence**.
